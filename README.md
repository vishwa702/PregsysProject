# Analysis and Estimation of Infant Mortality Rate and the Influence of Maternal Care on it.

## Summary

This project aims to analyze data on Infant Mortality Rate (IMR) and various factors of Prenatal Care from the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare of the Government of India. In this project, we analyze data from National Family Health Survey (NFHS) 2015-16 to unravel the underlying relationships between Infant Mortality Rate (IMR) and the influences of Maternal Care on it. We use Python for data cleaning, data analysis, and data visualization.

We build an interactive dashboard showing a map of India with key details about the IMR in those states. Clicking over it gives more specifics about the IMR scenario in that state. The project also has a prediction mechanism using regression which gives the IMR based on the factors.

Exploratory Analysis unearths some crucial correlations between IMR and Prenatal Care. Prenatal care is associated with lower IMR compared with no care. These results demonstrate prenatal care is associated with lower IMR. We solve the issue of missing values by replacing them with the average of the particular attribute of data. For this application, the Multiple Regression model provides the most accurate predictions. We use Linear Regression machine learning model to detect and find correlations underlying the data. We carry out a comparison between 5 different variants of Linear Regression models to assess which one performs best given the current scenario. Other models perform better with datasets of larger size. We use these models to make predictions, which could finally be used to make modifications and reforms to making healthcare plans.
